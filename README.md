# wikialinks
MacOS menu bar application for easier wikia editing.

To use this menu bar application, you need to build the project in Xcode. Once the project is done building, look at the Project Navigator on the left side of the screen. At the bottom, you'll find a folder called "Products", and in that folder and app, called "Wikia_links.app". You can right click this file and select "Show in Finder". From here, you can drag the folder to your Desktop or Applications folder for future use.
